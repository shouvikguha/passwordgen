# Password Generator Chrome Extension üîêüõ°Ô∏è

This Chrome Extension helps users create a secure, randomly generated password in an instant! The project leverages best practices as per the [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/20.x?topic=security-characters-that-are-valid-user-ids-passwords) and [NIST](https://rublon.com/blog/nist-password-guidelines/) guidelines on passwords. Using this tool ensures high-security protocols whilst delivering frictionless user interactions.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Generates passwords ranging from 8 to 20 characters. Users can choose from 4 password options, ensuring comprehensive protection and a password that fits any given criteria. 
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes for better visibility in different environments, or as to their liking. 
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can copy the generated password with a single click. Only the first copy action triggers an alert to notify the user, so they're aware of the functionality.
- **Validation Assistance**: Provides help if the password length is outside the acceptable range. If the user hovers over or clicks the help icon, they are provided with the same assistance.
- **Secure Practices**: Logic tailor-made to follow the security guidelines outlined in [IBM's valid characters](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/baw/20.x?topic=security-characters-that-are-valid-user-ids-passwords) and [NIST's password guidelines](https://rublon.com/blog/nist-password-guidelines/), to ensure high-security, but also to provide a set of universally acceptable passwords.
